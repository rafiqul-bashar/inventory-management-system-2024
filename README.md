- **Icon Integration:** Utilizes React Icons to seamlessly incorporate icons into the application.
- **TypeScript:** Enhances development by introducing static typing to React components and functions.
- **RESTful API:** Express.js serves as the backend, handling RESTful API requests for seamless communication with the MongoDB database.
- **Testing:** Includes unit tests for React components and utility functions using Jest and React Testing Library.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Framer Motion, React Icons
